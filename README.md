# vivcord-bot
Just the bot that's used in my discord guild, a lot more updates to do.

# Requirements
Made for Python 3.11, could work with older versions. Install discord-py and PyNaCl via pip --
```
pip install discord-py PyNaCL
```
No version requirements on either of those, use latest.

# Installation
Make sure you insert DISCORD_TOKEN into .env. If you don't know how, follow the docs to create a bot via: https://discord.com/developers/
```
DISCORD_TOKEN="YourDiscordBotToken"
```
Run as normal as such --
```
python3 main.py / python main.py
```

# Moar
Have fun, it's nothing special and it needs a lot more updates.
