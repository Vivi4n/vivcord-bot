# vivcord-bot
Just the administration bot used by my Discord guild, nothing too special. This is just a project for fun, but, hey, it's fully functional. Any cogs you don't need, you can just omit from main.py, as I realize anime_commands aren't for everyone, or any other cogs I happen to add in the future. There's a lot more stuff to add in the future so it feels a bit more polished and complete. Hope you like it ^_^

# Requirements
Made for Python 3.11, could work with older versions. Install discord-py, PyNaCl, aiohttp via pip --
```
pip install discord-py PyNaCL aiohttp
```
No version requirements on either of those, use latest.

# Installation
Make sure you insert DISCORD_TOKEN into .env. If you don't know how, follow the docs to create a bot via: https://discord.com/developers/
```
DISCORD_TOKEN="YourDiscordBotToken"
```
Run as normal as such --
```
python3 main.py / python main.py
```

# Moar
Have fun, I decided to build this as a fun little project specifically in Python, could have probably chosen another language, but Python is based.
